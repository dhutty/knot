# Knot

> An intertwining of threads

Those who communicate online each have their own preferences for the protocols and user agents they use; some of those preferences are based on aesthetic or familiarity, some are based on the kind of communication, some are based on technical capabilities in areas such as privacy/security, search/history or configurability/customization and some just default to the preferences of their personal network. Each individual and each community gives more or less weight to strengths in various areas such as ease of use.

Knot is an attempt to build a service that will allow everyone to use their preferred user agents and paradigms to participate in communication communities, taking some of the best ideas from email, mailing lists, usenet, zephyr, IRC, XMPP, various kinds of web forums, SMS and more. 

The fundamental idea is that:

_*Decoupling the messages/threads/channels from the transport/storage mechanisms allows the user agent software maximum flexibility to present information in a manner that is delightful to the human.*_

There are some other key ideas, currently in no particular order:

* self-hosted: anyone with a linux box (POSIX system?) and a network connection can host
* open semantic API; backwards and forwards compatible.
* distributed: options for federation & peer-to-peer
* Identity (but not necessarily real-name), Authentication/Authorization built-in
* Search/Browse (fts of archived messages, topics, users)
* Text based, with links to filetypes (clients can choose to auto-render links and/or the results of links)
* Messages should be threaded into conversations
* Filtering - positive filtering aids discoverability, negative filtering helps avoid spam. Both Active filtering (human-initiated), such as moderation or per-user/community rulesets and Passive filtering (automated), such as classification, can be either server-side, client-side or both.
* synchronous & asynchronous messaging
* what metadata is required?
